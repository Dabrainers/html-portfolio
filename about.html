  <h1>Moses Muraya</h1>
  <h2>Front End Developer</h2>
  <p>I build accessible, pixel-perfect digital experiences for the web.</p>
  <p>
    I’m a developer passionate about crafting accessible, pixel-perfect user interfaces that blend thoughtful design with robust engineering. My favorite work lies at the intersection of design and development, creating experiences that not only look great but are meticulously built for performance and usability.

  <p>
    In my spare time, I’m usually climbing, reading, hanging out with my wife and two cats.
